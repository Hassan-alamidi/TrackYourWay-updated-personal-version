This application is not finished and is nothing more than a college project that I personally intend on finishing for my portfolio
Installation
To install on computer for testing
1. For the application you must first have android studio installed to run this project on your computer. 
If you do not have android studio installed you can get it from this link
http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html 

2. For the server files your must either have a webserver and database (Cloud 9 is a good free alternative https://c9.io ) or install xampp and test the application locally
There are many tutorials on-line on how to install and make use of files in xampp.

3. start up android studio and open the project called TrackYourWay Not TrackYourWay-Portfolio 

4. Lastly you must goto DBRequest file in android studio and link all the URL strings upto the relevant files in your webserver.

5. now if everything has been setup correctly you should be able to run the project from an emulator in android studio
